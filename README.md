**Prologue:** `Is it down?` is a server side rendered application intended to show the statuses of domains. Influence from isitdown.com and downdetector.com but with a twist of being OS and developed with an intended use of tactical domains. This application intends to be as lightweight as possible, meaning with a few configuration files a docker container you can replicate this yourself. The backend is written in Python which utilizes Flask as a lightweight webserver framework which is connected to a MySQL instance. I am not a frontend developer, I am utilizing Bootstrap 5 and jQuerey to interact with the backend when needed. I am trying to limit the communication the frontend has with the back to maintain security, hence server side rendered. I intend to move the Bootstrap to use USWDS components.
